        <h1>ArtecBS Service Level Agreement</h1>
        <p>
          

Effective Starting: July 1, 2023.

Service Level Commitment. During the Subscription Term for which ArtecBS has agreed to provide a relevant Cloud Product to you, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a reliable service.

Definitions. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined are as set forth in the ArtecBS Cloud Terms of Service or your applicable agreement with ArtecBS for the relevant Cloud Products (Terms).
Monthly Uptime Percentage means 100% minus the percentage of Downtime minutes out of the total minutes in the relevant calendar month.
Downtime for a Cloud Product occurs when its Error Rate is greater than 5%.
Downtime Calculation Any outage that occurs during the maintenance window will be excluded from the service credit calculation.
Error Rate means, over a given 1-minute period, the percentage of your requests to a Cloud Product's Covered Experiences resulting in an error out of your total requests to those Covered Experiences. For cases in which we confirm all Covered Experiences were completely inoperable or unable to receive your requests, the Error Rate for that minute is 100%. If you attempted no requests to any of the Covered Experiences over a minute, the Error Rate is 0%.
The terms above are defined and calculated independently for each relevant Cloud Product.
